# solitary-accompanied
This is my game made for GMTK Game Jam 2021. Everything was created by me in 48 hours (apart from the font). Couple gets separated and lost in the desert after their anniversary sightseeing flight ends abruptly due to the plane malfunction. Can they find each other again or will they perish in the desert? That is up to you!

## Where to play

You can play the HTML5 build of the game here - https://dzejpi.itch.io/solitary-accompanied.

## How to open ...?
### Game
In order to open the game, you need to have a Game Maker 2. This game was made using GML only - no drag and drop, so donâ€™t search for it!

### Graphic assets
All graphic assets and their project files are in the `_graphics` folder. Due to the nature of 48 hours long jam, assets can be a little disorganised and a lot of assets were edited after they were exported, so sometimes you can notice they are different from the project file.

### Music & Sounds
You can find all music and sound resources in the `_sound` folder although music was unused, because it was unusable. If you want to check the music and sound project files, you will need:

* FL Studio; I have the Producer Edition v20.8.3.
* These plugins installed:
  * Kairatune - completely free.
  * Fruity DrumSynth Live - included in FL Studio.

Although you will probably not find anything interesting. Most of the sounds/music were made in a very crude way using presets.
